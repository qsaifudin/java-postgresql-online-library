# Online Library Borrowing System Using Java Spring Boot, VueJs and PostgreSQL

The Online Library Management System is a web application designed to manage an online library's borrowing system. It provides functionalities for users to register, login, borrow books, and for admins to track borrowing activities and manage books. The system is built using Java Spring Boot for the backend, Nuxt.js (Vue.js) for the frontend, and PostgreSQL for the database.

## Features
- User Registration and Login: Users can register for an account and log in to the system.
- Borrowing System: Users can borrow books from the library. Each user can only borrow one book at a time, and they must return the book before borrowing another one.
- Admin Dashboard: Admins have access to a dashboard where they can track all borrowing activities, including the status of borrowed books (borrowed, returned, or expired), and manage books.
- Automatic Deadline: The borrowing system automatically sets a deadline for returning borrowed books.
- Book Management (Admin): Admins can add new books to the library.

Detail setup instructions and system requirements are already available in the `README.me` file inside the backend and frontend folders.
